# Weather-App

This is the README file for our Weather Website, a web application that provides real-time weather information for cities around the world. The website is designed with two main tabs:

Present Weather: This tab displays the current weather information for a default city. It includes details such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Users can quickly check the weather conditions for the default city without the need for a manual search.

Search Weather: This tab allows users to search for the weather of any city using a weather data API. Users can input the name of the city they want to check the weather for and receive the latest weather data from the API.

# Features:
Display present weather information, including:

Temperature (in Celsius)
Humidity (as a percentage)
Cloudiness (in percentage)
Wind speed (in miles per hour or meters per second)
